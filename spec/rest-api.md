# REST API

The control plane listens on `0.0.0.0:8080` by default. All request and
response bodies are JSON except for the console WebSocket.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Handler | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/health` | `health_check` | Liveness probe |
| `GET` | `/vms` | `list_vms` | List all VMs |
| `POST` | `/vms` | `create_vm` | Create a new VM |
| `GET` | `/vms/{id}` | `get_vm` | Get a VM by id |
| `DELETE` | `/vms/{id}` | `delete_vm` | Delete a VM (also stops it) |
| `POST` | `/vms/{id}/start` | `start_vm` | Start / resume a VM |
| `POST` | `/vms/{id}/stop` | `stop_vm` | Stop a VM |
| `POST` | `/vms/{id}/pause` | `pause_vm` | Pause a running VM |
| `GET` | `/vms/{id}/console` | `get_console_info` | Return console-socket path and availability |
| `GET` | `/vms/{id}/console/ws` | `console_ws` | WebSocket upgrade — see below |
| `POST` | `/vms/{id}/devices` | `attach_device` | Attach a VFIO PCI device |
| `DELETE` | `/vms/{id}/devices` | `detach_device` | Detach a VFIO PCI device |
| `GET` | `/pci-devices` | `list_pci_devices` | Enumerate host PCI devices |

All handlers live in `crates/glidex-control-plane/src/api.rs`.

## Payloads

### `POST /vms`

```json
{
  "name": "my-vm",
  "vcpu_count": 2,
  "mem_size_mib": 1024,
  "kernel_image_path": "~/.glidex/vmlinux.bin",
  "rootfs_path": "~/.glidex/rootfs.ext4",
  "kernel_args": "console=ttyS0 root=/dev/vda reboot=k panic=1",
  "hypervisor": "qemu",
  "vfio_devices": ["/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:41:00.0"]
}
```

- `kernel_args`, `hypervisor`, `vfio_devices` are optional.
- `~` is expanded server-side (see [data-model.md](data-model.md)).
- Response: `201 Created` with a `VmResponse`.

### `POST /vms/{id}/devices`, `DELETE /vms/{id}/devices`

```json
{ "device_path": "/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:41:00.0" }
```

Semantics depend on VM state:

- **Running**: hot-plug via the hypervisor API. On success the
  config is updated and persisted; on persistence failure the
  hot-plug is rolled back.
- **Created / Stopped**: config-only mutation. The device will be
  present at next start.
- **Paused**: rejected with `invalid_state` (hot-plug while paused
  is a mess to reason about; require unpause first).

### `GET /vms/{id}/console`

```json
{
  "vm_id": "…",
  "console_socket_path": "/tmp/qemu-<id>.console.sock",
  "log_path": "/tmp/qemu-<id>.log",
  "available": true
}
```

`available` is `true` iff `state == Running`. This endpoint is used
by `gxctl` (which then `connect()`s to the Unix socket directly) and
by any client that wants to find the log file without opening the
WebSocket.

## Error model

All non-2xx responses are:

```json
{ "error": "<code>", "message": "<human readable>" }
```

Status code mapping (`api::error_to_response`):

| `VmManagerError` variant | HTTP | `error` code |
|---|---|---|
| `VmNotFound` | `404` | `not_found` |
| `VmAlreadyExists` | `409` | `conflict` |
| `InvalidState` | `400` | `invalid_state` |
| `HypervisorError` | `500` | `hypervisor_error` |
| `PersistenceError` | `500` | `persistence_error` |
| `HypervisorNotAvailable` | `503` | `hypervisor_unavailable` |

## Console WebSocket

### Protocol

`GET /vms/{id}/console/ws` upgrades to a WebSocket. The handler
`console_ws → bridge_console`:

1. Looks up the VM. If `VmNotFound`, responds `404`. Any other
   lookup error responds `500`.
2. Opens a `tokio::net::UnixStream` to the VM's `console_socket_path`.
   If the connect fails, sends a `Message::Text` containing the
   error string and then `Message::Close`.
3. Enters a `select!` loop:
   - Bytes read from the Unix socket → sent as `Message::Binary` to
     the browser.
   - `Message::Binary` / `Message::Text` from the browser → written
     to the Unix socket. Close / error / `None` from the browser
     ends the loop.

### Client expectations

- Use `binaryType = "arraybuffer"` on the `WebSocket`. The server
  only ever sends binary frames (except the very first frame in
  the connect-failed case, which is text).
- Writes are sent as binary; the server accepts either binary or
  text (text is treated as the UTF-8 byte sequence of its content).
- No framing — this is a byte stream of terminal data in both
  directions. The *only* transport semantics are WebSocket
  boundaries, which are irrelevant to the consumer.

### Replay-on-connect behavior

The console Unix socket on the server is listened on by a proxy
thread inside the hypervisor backend. That thread replays the
captured log file to every newly-accepted client before starting
live broadcast. So opening a WebSocket on a VM that has already
booted will immediately flush the boot-time output into your xterm.
