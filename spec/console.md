# Console subsystem

Each running VM's serial console is:

1. **Captured** to an append-only log file on disk.
2. **Broadcast** to any number of concurrently-connected clients
   over a per-VM Unix socket (`/tmp/<prefix>-<id>.console.sock`).
3. **Bridged** to browsers via a WebSocket endpoint on the control
   plane.

This document explains the invariants that make that work and why
the code is structured the way it is.

## Physical I/O

How the guest's serial bytes reach the control plane differs per
hypervisor:

- **Firecracker / QEMU** — we allocate a `pty(7)` pair ourselves,
  pass the slave fd as the hypervisor's stdin/stdout/stderr
  (`setsid()` in `pre_exec` to detach from our controlling tty), and
  keep the master fd. For QEMU we additionally pass `-serial stdio`.
  For Firecracker, the hypervisor naturally uses its stdio.
- **Cloud-Hypervisor** — CH allocates *its own* PTY when the VM
  boots. We discover the slave's path by querying
  `GET /vm.info` and then open it ourselves.

In every case the control plane ends up owning an fd that reads
serial output and accepts serial input.

## Console proxy thread

Per VM, when the hypervisor process is launched, we spawn **one OS
thread** (not a Tokio task) running `console_proxy_loop`. The code
for each backend is nearly identical. Inputs:

- The PTY fd (as `OwnedFd` for Firecracker/QEMU, or `File` for CH).
- A `UnixListener` already bound to the console socket path.
- A `File` handle opened append-only on the log file.
- An `Arc<AtomicBool>` "running" flag.

The loop does four things per tick:

1. **Non-blocking `accept()`** on the listener. On a new client:
   - Re-open the log file read-only, read the whole captured
     history, and write it to the client first. This is what gives
     late-joining browsers the pre-boot output.
   - Push the client stream (non-blocking) onto a `Vec<UnixStream>`.
2. **Read from the PTY** (non-blocking). For non-empty reads:
   - Append to the log file.
   - Write to every client; drop clients that error.
3. **Read from each client** (non-blocking) and write their bytes
   back to the PTY master.
4. `thread::sleep(10ms)` to avoid a busy spin.

### Invariant: listener outlives the PTY

The listener is held by the thread until `running.store(false)`.
Specifically, the loop **does not break** when the PTY EOFs. On
`Ok(0)` or an error from the PTY read, we flip a local `pty_alive`
flag that skips future PTY I/O but keeps accepting connections and
replaying the log.

Why: a crashed guest is the moment you most want to read the log.
If the thread exited on PTY EOF, the listener would drop, the Unix
socket would become inert, and `gxctl connect` / the browser WS
bridge would fail with `Connection refused` — with no way to see
what the kernel printed before dying. See
`{qemu,cloud_hypervisor,firecracker}.rs::console_proxy_loop` — all
three use the same `pty_alive` flag.

### Thread shutdown

`HypervisorProcess::kill` sets the `running` flag to `false`, kills
the child process, joins the console thread, and unlinks the socket
files. The thread notices the flag at the top of the next loop
iteration (worst case ~10 ms later).

## Log files

- Path: `/tmp/<prefix>-<id>.log`
- Lifecycle: truncated on hypervisor spawn, appended during the
  VM's lifetime, left on disk after `kill` so the user can still
  `cat` it.
- Replay semantics: every new client read the whole log before
  starting live broadcast. Log files can grow unbounded — no
  rotation. Scale is "the lifetime of a dev microVM", not
  "production logging infrastructure."

## Console Unix socket

- Path: `/tmp/<prefix>-<id>.console.sock`
- Type: `SOCK_STREAM` Unix domain socket.
- Multi-client: the proxy thread `accept`s any number of clients
  and broadcasts every byte of output to all of them. Input from
  any client is written to the PTY (so clients can fight for the
  keyboard — accepted trade-off; there's no locking).
- Protocol: **raw byte stream** in both directions. No framing, no
  handshake. Anything fancier would need to be invented on top.

## Clients

Two first-party clients connect to the console Unix socket:

- **gxctl `connect` command** — sets stdin to raw mode, spawns a
  reader thread, forwards bytes bidirectionally until the user
  hits `Ctrl+]`. Works *locally* only (needs filesystem access to
  `/tmp`). See [cli.md](cli.md).
- **Control plane's own WebSocket bridge** (`api.rs::bridge_console`)
  — lets remote browsers reach the console. This is the only way
  to attach from a different machine.

## Browser bridge

`GET /vms/:id/console/ws` in the control plane:

1. Validates the VM id.
2. `UnixStream::connect` to the VM's console socket.
3. Upgrades the HTTP request to a WebSocket and enters a
   `tokio::select!` copying bytes both ways.

On the UI side, `crates/glidex-ui/ui/src/pages/VmConsole.tsx`:

- Creates an `@xterm/xterm` `Terminal` with the `@xterm/addon-fit`
  addon.
- Opens `ws(s)://<location.host>/api/vms/:id/console/ws` with
  `binaryType = "arraybuffer"`.
- On `message`, writes the received `ArrayBuffer` (or string) into
  the terminal.
- On `term.onData`, UTF-8 encodes and sends as a binary frame.
- Disposes terminal + socket + listeners on unmount.

### Dev-server proxying

Vite's dev server must forward WebSocket upgrades for this to work.
See `vite.config.ts` — the `/api` proxy is configured with
`ws: true`.

## Observability gaps (intentionally unsolved)

- **Resize**: we don't yet propagate terminal size. xterm.js sends
  a resize event; we currently ignore it. A future `Message::Text`
  sub-protocol could carry PTY ioctls. Not needed for the serial
  console of a microVM, which is 80x24 by default and not reshaped.
- **Authentication**: the WebSocket has none. Anyone who can reach
  `:8080` can read/write every console. This matches the overall
  security model (see [README](README.md) "non-goals").
