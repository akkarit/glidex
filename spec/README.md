# Glidex Design Specification

This directory is the authoritative design reference for Glidex — a
control plane for managing KVM-based microVMs across multiple
hypervisor backends (QEMU, Cloud-Hypervisor, Firecracker).

The top-level `README.md` is a *user* document. Documents here are for
contributors: they capture **invariants**, **contracts between
components**, and **why** the code is shaped the way it is — things a
fresh reader cannot infer just by reading the source.

## Contents

| Document | Scope |
|---|---|
| [architecture.md](architecture.md) | Processes, layers, and request/data flow |
| [data-model.md](data-model.md) | VM/VmConfig/VmState types, persistence schema, reconciliation |
| [rest-api.md](rest-api.md) | HTTP endpoints, payloads, error model, console WebSocket |
| [hypervisors.md](hypervisors.md) | Hypervisor trait contract and per-backend implementations |
| [console.md](console.md) | Console proxy thread, listener invariant, WebSocket bridge, xterm |
| [cli.md](cli.md) | `gxctl` interactive CLI, command semantics, console attach loop |
| [web-ui.md](web-ui.md) | Vite + React UI structure, routes, API client, dev-proxy |
| [installer.md](installer.md) | `glidex-install` bootstrap flow and what it brings up |

## Goals

1. **Uniform microVM control across hypervisors.** A single REST API
   and CLI drive Firecracker, Cloud-Hypervisor, and QEMU identically
   from the caller's point of view, including VFIO PCI passthrough
   and interactive console I/O.
2. **Durable VM state.** A VM survives control-plane restarts: its
   config is persisted before being acknowledged, and process-level
   orphaning is reconciled on startup.
3. **Observable console.** Every VM's serial output is captured to a
   log file *and* broadcast to any number of concurrent clients
   (CLI + browser) over the same Unix socket. Clients that connect
   after the guest has died still get a useful view.
4. **Minimal host dependencies, maximal out-of-the-box experience.**
   One `cargo run -p glidex-install` stands the system up, including
   a runnable sample kernel + rootfs.

## Non-goals

- Clustering / multi-host orchestration.
- User authentication and authorization on the REST API. The control
  plane binds to `0.0.0.0:8080` and assumes the host is trusted by
  whoever can reach it; there are no accounts, tokens, or ACLs.
- Persistent networking configuration (bridges, TAPs, IP allocation).
  Current scope is boot + console + VFIO; networking is the user's
  responsibility via kernel args or VFIO NICs.

Conventions that apply across documents:

- File paths in these docs are relative to the repo root.
- Code references use `path:line` so they navigate in most tooling.
- Any claim about runtime behavior that is not obvious from the
  source should be backed by a `Why:` or `Invariant:` note.
