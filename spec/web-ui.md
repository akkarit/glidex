# Web UI

Two crates cooperate to deliver the UI:

- `crates/glidex-ui` (Rust bin) — a thin launcher that runs
  `bun run dev` inside `crates/glidex-ui/ui/`. Exists so the UI can
  be started with `cargo run -p glidex-ui` as a peer of
  `cargo run -p glidex-control-plane`. No rendering happens here.
- `crates/glidex-ui/ui` — the actual Vite + React + TypeScript app.

There is currently no production build path wired into the launcher;
development mode (Vite HMR) is the only supported mode.

## Stack

- **Vite 6** dev server on `:5173`.
- **React 19** with **react-router-dom 7** for client-side routing.
- **TypeScript 5** (strict).
- **Tailwind CSS 3** for styling; config in `ui/tailwind.config.js`.
- **@xterm/xterm + @xterm/addon-fit** for the VM console page.
- **bun** is the package manager (the lockfile is `bun.lock`).

## Dev-server proxy

`ui/vite.config.ts` proxies everything under `/api` to the control
plane on `:8080`, stripping the `/api` prefix. WebSocket upgrades
are forwarded (`ws: true`) so `/api/vms/:id/console/ws` resolves to
`ws://localhost:8080/vms/:id/console/ws`.

Consequence: the frontend never has to know the server URL.
Everything is same-origin from the browser's perspective.

## Routes

| Path | Component |
|---|---|
| `/` | `Dashboard` |
| `/vms/:id` | `VmDetail` |
| `/vms/:id/console` | `VmConsole` |
| `*` | `NotFound` |

## API client

`ui/src/api.ts` wraps `fetch` with a single `handleResponse` helper
that parses `ApiError` bodies into thrown `Error`s formatted as
`"<error>: <message>"`. The base URL is hard-coded `/api` — the
Vite proxy handles forwarding in dev.

## `VmConsole` contract

The console page is the non-obvious component. It:

1. Creates an `xterm` `Terminal` and fits it to a ref'd container.
2. Opens `ws(s)://<location.host>/api/vms/:id/console/ws` with
   `binaryType = "arraybuffer"`.
3. Maps:
   - **WS → term**: `message` event → `term.write(Uint8Array)` for
     binary frames, `term.write(string)` for text frames (used by
     the server to surface a connect failure).
   - **term → WS**: `term.onData(d => ws.send(TextEncoder.encode(d)))`.
4. Tracks a `Status` enum (`connecting | connected | closed | error`)
   for the status pill shown in the page header.
5. On unmount, disposes the input handler, closes the socket, and
   disposes the terminal — the order matters to avoid writing to a
   disposed terminal.

See [console.md](console.md) for how the server side of that
WebSocket is implemented.

## State management

There is none beyond React's built-in hooks. Lists are fetched on
mount and refreshed after mutations by re-calling the list
endpoint. No global store, no query cache. If that becomes painful
(polling, optimistic updates, cross-component invalidation) a
lightweight option like TanStack Query is the natural upgrade.

## Styling conventions

Tailwind utility classes inline in JSX. No CSS-in-JS, no CSS
modules. Page-level containers follow a common pattern
(`max-w-* mx-auto p-* bg-white rounded-xl shadow-md border`) but
there's no reusable "page shell" component — each page wires its
own layout.
